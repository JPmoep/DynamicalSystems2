    "We study the logistic map $g\\colon x 􏰀\\mapsto 4x(1 − x)$. First, it suffices to show the statement for intervals $[a,b]$ since those generate the $\\sigma$-algebra. Second, we have that the preimage of $[a,b]$ is given by $[c,d]\\cup[c',d']$, where the first interval is in the left half and the second is in the right half. On each half, $g$ is smooth and invertible. That means that\n",

    "The integral equality follows directly from the transformation of integrals (\"change of variables (in integral)\") formula that you certainly discussed in your measure theory class, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure#Main_property:_change-of-variables_formula). The converse statement is easily verified by applying the integral equality to characteristic functions of measurable sets."
